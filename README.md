# Steve Jobs’s Definition of “Smart” Will Reprogram Your Idea of Intelligence

I know plenty of highly intelligent people. Some of them can recite classic literature. Others will surprise you with their knowledge of current events. Many of them offer amazing advice. And yet, most of them still struggle to make a dent in the world.

Why is that? Why do they fail to get their careers and businesses off the ground?
Part of the answer lies in our definition of intelligence.

We’ve grown accustomed to defining intelligence as a combination of high IQ and high EQ. These are mostly inborn characteristics — which is convenient for us, since we can blame our lack of success on bad luck.

Although there is some truth to that. Research is piling up telling us that IQ is a “reasonable” predictor of financial success. However, as you very well know from your own life, that is not the entire truth, as there are plenty of high IQ individuals who live modest lives, and plenty of wealthy people who aren’t geniuses.

Steve Jobs: “You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does”

Recently, I’ve come across a video where a young Steve Jobs explains a key characteristic of what he considers to be a smart person.

I expected to hear something among the lines of “thinking out of the box” and “unflinching dedication.” Instead, I discovered one of the most profound pieces of advice I’ve ever heard.

“A lot of [what it means to be smart] is the ability to zoom out, like you’re in a city and you could look at the whole thing from the 80th floor down at the city. And while other people are trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B reading these stupid little maps, you could just see it in front of you. You can see the whole thing.”
Jobs masterfully notes that smart people often make connections that seem obvious to them, but perplexing to others — simply because they have developed the skill of “zooming out” to get a better view of the big picture.

This, of course, sounds great and we can all agree that in order to change the world you need to clearly see the world. But how do you do that? How do you increase your intelligence to become what Jobs considers to be a “smart” person?

According to the visionary — it’s all about having unique life experiences.

“You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does, or else you’re gonna make the same connections and you won’t be innovative. […] You might want to think about going to Paris and being a poet for a few years. Or you might want to go to a third-world country — I’d highly advise that.”
